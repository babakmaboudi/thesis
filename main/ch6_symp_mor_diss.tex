\chapter{Symplectic Model Order Reduction of Dissipative Hamiltonian Systems} \label{chapter:6}

It was discussed in \Cref{chapter:4,chapter:5}, that if the basis for the reduced space is not chosen carefully, the symplectic symmetry of Hamiltonian will be destroyed by model reduction. To resolve this issue, the symplectic MOR constructs a reduced order configuration space that inherits symmetries of the full configuration space. By using a proper time integrator scheme, the symmetries are preserved in the reduced system. A greedy-type algorithm is developed in \Cref{alg:4.1,alg:5.1} for construction of a basis for such a reduced configuration space.

Most models in engineering appear as a dissipative perturbation of a Hamiltonian system. In these systems, conservation of energy is taken as a fundamental principle of the system dynamics, while dissipative forces, e.g. friction, can change the energy of the system \cite{vanderSchaft:2014:PST:2693645.2693646}. As the energy is no longer preserved for such systems, existing methods can no longer be applied directly \cite{doi:10.1137/140978922}.

For dissipative and forced Hamiltonian system, Peng et al. \cite{peng2016geometric} suggest a symplectic model reduction method that preserves the Hamiltonian and the dissipative structure of the original system. However, since this method uses a symplectic integrator for a non-conservative system, there is no guarantee that the evolution of the energy is translated correctly to the reduced system.

In the context of network modeling and circuit simulation, considerable work has been done in the development of structure preserving, and in particular energy preserving, model reduction techniques. Model reduction for port-Hamiltonian systems are given in \cite{polyuga2010structure,beattie2011structure,doi:10.1137/15M1055085} and the references therein. These methods use a Krylov or a Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) approach to construct a reduced port-Hamiltonian system that preserves the passivity, and, thus, the stability of the original system. However, these methods do not generally guarantee the correct distribution of the energy among the energy consuming and energy storing units. Furthermore, over long time integration, accumulation of local errors might produce an erroneous solution.

This chapter presents the reduced dissipative Hamiltonian (RDH) method as a structure preserving model reduction approach for dissipative Hamiltonian systems. A key difference between this method and the other existing methods is that the RDH enables the reduced system to be integrated using a symplectic integrator. By considering a canonical heat bath, also known as hidden strings \cite{figotin2007hamiltonian,figotin2005spectral}, the reduced system is extended to a closed and conservative system. Therefore, a symplectic time integrator can be used to guarantee conservation of the system energy and the correct dissipation of energy. Furthermore, the hidden strings assure that the local errors in the dissipation of energy do not accumulate, resulting in a correct evolution of the system energy.  

This chapter is organized as follows: \Cref{p3.sec:2} covers the required background on dissipative Hamiltonian systems and the Hamiltonian extension. In \Cref{p3.sec:3} we discussion the symplectic model reduction for Hamiltonian systems and introduce the reduced dissipative Hamiltonian method. Accuracy, stability and efficiency of the RDH method is discussed in \Cref{p3.sec:4}, and illustrated through simulation of the dissipative wave equation and a linear port-Hamiltonian system of an electrical circuit. We offer conclusive remarks in \Cref{p3.sec:5}.


\section{Dissipative Hamiltonian Systems and Hamiltonian Extensions} \label{p3.sec:2}

Many systems in engineering and science appear as a perturbation of a Hamiltonian system, where the perturbation can be regarded as dissipation. In these systems, the energy tends to decrease over time, and thus, the symmetry expressed in \Cref{theorem:2.9} and the conservation law in \Cref{theorem:2.10} are violated. Therefore, it is common to take the conservation of energy as a fundamental principle and consider the dissipative system coupled with a heat bath that absorbs the dissipated energy of the original system. 

To account for dissipation in a quadratic Hamiltonian $H(z) = \frac 1 2 z^T K^T K  z$, we reformulate a Hamiltonian system as a time dispersive and dissipative (TDD) \cite{figotin2007hamiltonian} system 
\begin{equation} \label{p3.eq:2.4}
	\left\{
	\begin{aligned}
		& \dot {z} = \mathbb J_{2n} K^T f(t), \\
		& z(0) = z_0,
	\end{aligned}
	\right.
\end{equation}
where $f$ is the solution to the Volterra integral equation \cite{jerri1999introduction,corduneanu1991integral}
\begin{equation} \label{p3.eq:2.4.1}
	f(t) + \int_0^t \chi(t-s) \cdot f(s)\ ds = K z.
\end{equation}
Here $\chi:\mathbb R^+\to \mathbb R^{2n\times 2n}$ is a bounded matrix valued function with respect to the Frobenius norm and is called the \emph{general susceptibility}. Note that the integral term in (\ref{p3.eq:2.4.1}) accounts to the accumulation of the dissipation, whereas $\chi(s) = 0$ implies \eqref{p3.eq:2.4} is equivalent to \eqref{p1.eq:SyMo:1}. Furthermore, under suitable assumptions on $K$, both \eqref{p1.eq:SyMo:1} and \eqref{p3.eq:2.4} are well-posed \cite{figotin2007hamiltonian}.

\begin{example} \label{example:2.1}
Consider the dynamics of the damped harmonic oscillator
\begin{equation} \label{p3.eq:2.5}
	\ddot q + r \dot q + k q = 0
\end{equation}
where $k$ is the Hooke's constant and $r$ is the spring's damping factor. Note that without a damping term, (\ref{p3.eq:2.5}) is a Hamiltonian system. The TDD formulation for the damped harmonic oscillator takes the form (\ref{p3.eq:2.4}) with
\begin{equation}
	z = \begin{pmatrix}
	q \\ \dot q
	\end{pmatrix},
       	\quad K = 
	\begin{pmatrix}
	1 & 0 \\
	0 & \sqrt{k}
	\end{pmatrix}, \quad \chi(t) = r.
\end{equation}
%\begin{equation} \label{eq:2.6}
%	\dot q(t) = f(t), \quad \dot p(t) = - k q(t), \quad f(t) + \int_0^t r f(s) \ ds = p(t).
%\end{equation}
Here $\mathbb J_{2n} = \mathbb J_{2}$, $(q,\dot q)^T$ is the canonical coordinate and the susceptibility is the constant function $r$.
\end{example}

It is shown in \cite{figotin2007hamiltonian,figotin2005spectral} that under natural assumptions on the linear susceptibility $\chi(t)$ (see below), one can couple a TDD system of the form \eqref{p3.eq:2.4} with a canonical heat bath where the dissipated energy is captured in the heat bath in a canonical sense. In other words, one can construct a Hilbert space $\mathcal H$ and an isometric injection $I:\mathbb R^{2n} \to \mathbb R^{2n}\times \mathcal H^{2n}$ where the solution $z$ to \eqref{p3.eq:2.4} is the projection of $x$ onto $\mathbb R^{2n}$, and $x$ is the solution to
\begin{equation} \label{p3.eq:2.7}
	\dot x = \mathcal J_{2n} \frac{\delta H_{\text{ex}}}{\delta x}.
\end{equation}
Here $H_{\text{ex}}:\mathbb R^{2n}\times \mathcal H^{2n} \to \mathbb R$ is an extended quadratic Hamiltonian function and $\mathcal J_{2n}$ is the symplectic operator defined on $\mathbb R^{2n}\times \mathcal H^{2n}$ respectively.


\begin{theorem} \cite{figotin2007hamiltonian}
Suppose that $K$ is full rank and $\chi(t)$ is symmetric. Then there is a quadratic extension to (\ref{p3.eq:2.4}) of the form (\ref{p3.eq:2.7}), if
\begin{equation} \label{p3.eq:2.8}
	\text{Im}(\xi\hat{\chi}(\xi)) \geq 0, \quad \forall \xi = \omega + i\eta, \ \eta \geq 0,
\end{equation}
where $\hat{\chi}$ is the Fourier-Laplace transform of $\chi$
\begin{equation} \label{p3.eq:2.9}
	\hat{\chi}(\xi) = \int_0^\infty e^{i\xi t} \chi(t)\ dt.
\end{equation}
\end{theorem}
When $\chi$ is a constant symmetric matrix, condition (\ref{p3.eq:2.8}) corresponds to $\chi$ being positive semi-definite \cite{figotin2007hamiltonian}. In this case the Hamiltonian extension to (\ref{p3.eq:2.4}) reads
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
		\label{p3.eq:2.10.a} & \dot{z}(t) = \mathbb J_{2n} K^T f(t), \\
		\label{p3.eq:2.10.b} & \partial_t \phi(t,x) = \theta(t,x), \\
		\label{p3.eq:2.10.c} & \partial_t \theta(t,x) = \partial_x^2 \phi(t,x) + \sqrt 2 \delta_0(x) \cdot \sqrt{\chi}  f(t), 
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
together with the initial condition
\begin{equation} \label{p3.eq:2.10.1}
	z(0) = z_0,\quad \phi(0,\cdot) = 0, \quad \theta(0,\cdot) = 0.
\end{equation}
Here $\theta$ and $\phi$ are vector valued functions in $\mathcal H^{2n}$, $\delta_0(s)$ is the Dirac's delta function, $\sqrt{ \chi}$ is the matrix square root of $\chi$ and $f$ is the solution to the equation
\begin{equation} \label{p3.eq:2.11}
	f(t) + \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{ \chi } \phi(t,0) = Kz(t).
\end{equation}
Equations (\ref{p3.eq:2.10.b}) and (\ref{p3.eq:2.10.c}) are equations for a vibrating string, and can be solved analytically
\begin{equation} \label{p3.eq:2.12}
	\phi(t,x) = \frac {\sqrt 2} 2 \int_0^{t-|x|} \sqrt{\chi} f(s)\ ds,\quad \theta(t,x) = \frac{\sqrt 2}{2} \cdot \sqrt{\chi} f(t - |x|).
\end{equation}
We can recover (\ref{p3.eq:2.4.1}) by substituting (\ref{p3.eq:2.12}) into (\ref{p3.eq:2.11}). The extended Hamiltonian $H_\text{ex}$ for the system \Cref{p3.eq:2.10.a,p3.eq:2.10.b,p3.eq:2.10.c} takes the quadratic from
\begin{equation} \label{p3.eq:2.13}
	H_\text{ex}(z,\phi,\theta) = \frac 1 2 \left( \| Kz - \phi(t,0) \|_2^2 + \| \theta(t) \|^2_{\mathcal H^{2n} } + \| \partial_x\phi(t)\|^2_{\mathcal H^{2n} }\right),
\end{equation}
where $\| \cdot \|_2$ is the Euclidean norm on $\mathbb R^{2n}$ and $\| \cdot \|_{\mathcal H^{2n}}$ is the induced norm from the inner product on $\mathcal H^{2n}$. 

Equations (\ref{p3.eq:2.10.b}) and (\ref{p3.eq:2.10.c}) are called the \emph{hidden strings}. The dissipation of energy in the original system (\ref{p3.eq:2.4}) is carried away, as vibrations, along the added strings making the extended system conservative. The Hamiltonian extension of the damped harmonic oscillator in Example \ref{example:2.1} is exactly the Lamb model \cite{lamb:1900} which is a harmonic oscillator coupled with a vibrating string, and the tension in the string causes linear dissipation in the dynamics of the harmonic oscillator.

Note that the time integration of \Cref{p3.eq:2.10.a,p3.eq:2.10.b,p3.eq:2.10.c} involves the integration of $f$ in (\ref{p3.eq:2.12}). In general, the history of $f(t)$ must be stored and may cause storage limitation in long-time integration. However, we are interested solely in finding $z(t)$ which depends on $f$ at time $t$, and $\phi(t,0)$, i.e. the integral of the history of $f$. So by carefully choosing a quadrature rule that uses the same quadrature nodes as the time integrator we can avoid storing the history of $f$. For example for the trapezoidal rule, we recover the recursive relation
\begin{equation} \label{p3.eq:2.14}
	\int_{0}^{t_n} f(s) \ ds \approx \frac{\Delta t}{2} f(t_n) + \frac{\Delta t}{2} f(t_{n-1}) + \int_{0}^{t_{n-1}} f(s) \ ds,
\end{equation}
where $\Delta t$ is the time step. The recursive relation in (\ref{p3.eq:2.14}) suggests that storing the value of the integral term together with the state of $f$ in the previous time step suffices to evaluate the integral for the new time step. For other interpolation based quadrature rules, we can construct similar recursive rules of the form
\begin{equation}
	\int_{0}^{t_n} f(s) \ ds \approx \sum_{i=0}^{k} \omega_i f(t_{n-i})  + \int_{0}^{t_{n-k}} f(s) \ ds
\end{equation}
for some quadrature weights $\omega_i$, $i=1,\dots,k$ with $k\ll n$. Thus, time integration of \Cref{p3.eq:2.10.a,p3.eq:2.10.b,p3.eq:2.10.c}, only requires storage of $k$ evaluations of $f$.


\section{The Reduced Dissipative Hamiltonian Method} \label{p3.sec:3}

Since the symplectic model reduction in discussed in \Cref{chapter:4,chapter:5} are based on the conservation law in Theorem \ref{theorem:2.10}, it can no longer be applied to dissipative Hamiltonian systems. Instead in the reduced dissipative Hamiltonian method, we considers a Hamiltonian extension to a dissipative Hamiltonian system to construct a closed system. A symplectic model reduction can then be naturally applied to conserve the total energy.

Consider a dissipative Hamiltonian system of the form (\ref{p3.eq:2.4}) with a quadratic Hamiltonian, $H(z) = z^TK^TKz$. Since $K^TK$ is symmetric and positive definite, it has a unique Cholesky factorization $K^TK = L^T L$ where $L$ is upper triangular \cite{strang09}. So we can write 
\begin{equation} \label{p3.eq:3.7}
H(z) = z^T L^T L z.
\end{equation}
Further, suppose that the solution $z(t)$ lies on a low-dimensional symplectic subspace such that $z \approx Ay$, where $A$ is an ortho-symplectic matrix of the size $2n\times 2k$ and $y$ is the expansion coefficients of $z$ in the basis of $A$. The Hamiltonian $H$ then takes the form
\begin{equation} \label{p3.eq:3.8}
	H(z) \approx H(Ay) = y^T A^T L^T L A y.
\end{equation}
Since $A^T L^T L A$ is symmetric and positive definite, it too has a unique Cholesky factorization $\tilde L^T \tilde L$ where $\tilde L = A^T L A$ is an upper triangular matrix of size $2k \times 2k$. Writing (\ref{p3.eq:2.4}) in terms of the reduced coordinates $y$ and the Hamiltonian (\ref{p3.eq:3.7}) reads
\begin{equation} \label{p3.eq:3.9}
		A\dot{y}(t) = \mathbb J_{2n} L^T f(t) + r(z),
\end{equation}
together with the complementary equation
\begin{equation} \label{p3.eq:3.10}
	f(t) + \sqrt 2 \cdot \sqrt{\chi} \phi(t,0) = LAy.
\end{equation}
The symplectic Galerkin projection implies
\begin{align} \label{p3.eq:3.11}
	& \dot y(t) = \mathbb J_{2k} A^T L^T f(t), \\
	& A^T f(t) + \sqrt{2} A^T \sqrt{\chi} \phi(t,0) = A^T L A y,
\end{align}
where we use the fact that $A^+\mathbb J_{2n} = \mathbb{J}_{2k} A^T$. If we define $f = A \tilde f$, $\phi = A \tilde \phi$, $\theta = A\tilde \theta$ and the \emph{reduced susceptibility} as $\tilde \chi = A^T \chi A$ we recover the reduced Hamiltonian system
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
		\label{p3.eq:3.12.a} & \dot{y}(t) = \mathbb J_{2k} {\tilde L}^T \tilde f(t), \\
		\label{p3.eq:3.12.b} & \partial_t \tilde \phi(t,x) = \tilde \theta(t,x),\\
		\label{p3.eq:3.12.c} & \partial_t \tilde \theta(t,x) = \partial_x^2 \tilde \phi(t,x) + \sqrt 2 \delta_0(x) \cdot \sqrt{\tilde \chi}  \tilde f(t),
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
together with the auxiliary equation
\begin{equation} \label{p3.eq:3.13}
	\tilde f(t) + \sqrt{2} \sqrt{\tilde \chi} \tilde \phi(t,0) = \tilde L y.
\end{equation}
\Cref{p3.eq:3.12.a,p3.eq:3.12.b,p3.eq:3.12.c} is a Hamiltonian system on the symplectic linear vector space $\mathbb R^{2k} \times \mathcal H^{2k}$ and contributes to the \emph{reduced TDD system}
\begin{equation} \label{p3.eq:3.14}
	\dot {y} = \mathbb J_{2k} \tilde L^T \tilde f(t), \quad \tilde f(t) + \int_0^t \tilde \chi\cdot \tilde f(s)\ ds = \tilde L y.
\end{equation}
Therefore, the system energy will be conserved along integral curves of \Cref{p3.eq:3.12.a,p3.eq:3.12.b,p3.eq:3.12.c}.

We point out that the transformation that connects \Cref{p3.eq:2.10.a,p3.eq:2.10.b,p3.eq:2.10.c}) to \Cref{p3.eq:3.12.a,p3.eq:3.12.b,p3.eq:3.12.c} is given by
\begin{equation}
	\mathbf A = \begin{pmatrix}
		A& 0 \\
		0& A
	\end{pmatrix} : \mathbb R^{2n} \times \mathcal H^{2n} \to \mathbb R^{2k} \times \mathcal H^{2k}.
\end{equation}
This is a symplectic transformation, since $\mathbf A^T \mathcal J_{2n} \mathbf A = \mathcal J_{2k}$. Furthermore, the dissipation of energy in the reduced system only depends on the reduced susceptibility. Thus, the choice of $A$ should be independent of the hidden strings $(\phi, \theta)$. In other words, if the reduced space is chosen to be a symplectic subspace, then the actions of model reduction and Hamiltonian extension commute. We summarize the algorithm for model reduction of dissipative Hamiltonian systems in \Cref{alg:6.1}.

\begin{algorithm} 
\caption{The Reduced Dissipative Hamiltonian Method (RDH)} \label{alg:6.1}
\begin{algorithmic} [1]
	\State Construct the Hamiltonian extension \Cref{p3.eq:2.10.a,p3.eq:2.10.b,p3.eq:2.10.c}) to the original TDD system (\ref{p3.eq:2.4}).
	\State Collect the snapshots $z(t_i)$, $i=1,\dots,N$ through time integration of the extended Hamiltonian.
	\State Construct an ortho-symplectic basis $A$.
	\State Define $\tilde L = A^T L A$, $\tilde \chi = A^T \chi A$ and construct the reduced dissipative Hamiltonian system \Cref{p3.eq:3.12.a,p3.eq:3.12.b,p3.eq:3.12.c}
\end{algorithmic}
\vspace{0.5cm}
\end{algorithm}

Note that Algorithm \ref{alg:6.1} does not depend on the choice of the method to construct an ortho-symplectic basis $A$. Thus, for basis generation, the symplectic greedy or any SVD-based methods discussed in \Cref{chapter:4} can be used.

The main advantage of the RDH method compared to the existing methods is that it enables the reduced system to be integrated using a symplectic integrator. The reduced system constructed using the RDH is a closed Hamiltonian system, therefore the conservation law in \Cref{theorem:2.10} holds and a symplectic integrator guarantees that the total energy is preserved in the reduced system. Alternative methods, e.g. \cite{peng2016geometric,polyuga2010structure,beattie2011structure}, either integrate the reduced system with a non-symplectic integrator, or do not construct a closed reduced system which result in accumulation of local errors or unstable solution during long time integration, respectively \cite{hairer2006geometric}.

The following theorem provides an indication for the boundedness of the reduced system.
\begin{theorem}
Consider the TDD system (\ref{p3.eq:2.4}) together with the initial condition (\ref{p3.eq:2.10.1}). If in the absence of dissipation $(\chi = 0)$, a bounded open neighborhood $U\subset \mathbb R^{2n}$ of $z_0$ exists such that $H(z)<c$, for some constant value $c > H(z_0)$, then the RDH method yields a bounded reduced system.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof} For a Hamiltonian of the form (\ref{p3.eq:3.7}), $H(z)\geq 0$ for all $z\in \mathbb R^{2n}$. It is shown in \cite{figotin2007hamiltonian,figotin2005spectral} that for a symmetric and positive definite $\chi$, $\frac d {dt} H(z(t)) \leq 0$. Therefore, for all $0\leq t <\infty$, $H(z) < c$ which implies $z(t) \in U$. Now suppose that the symplectic basis $A$ is used to construct the RDH reduced system (\ref{p3.eq:3.12.a})-(\ref{p3.eq:3.12.c}) such that $y_0 = A^+z_0$. It is easily checked that $V = \text{Range}(A)\cap U$ is a bounded open neighborhood of $z_0$ and that $H(z) = H(Ay) < c$ for all $z \in V$. Since $\tilde H(y) = H(Ay)$ is a Hamiltonian function for the dissipative Hamiltonian system (\ref{p3.eq:3.14}) and that $\tilde \chi$ is symmetric and positive definite, then $\frac d {dt} \tilde H(y) \leq0$. This implies that $\tilde H(y)<c$ and $y(t)\in U$ for all $0\leq t <\infty$. Also it is easy to check that the boundedness of the solution of the original TDD system implies boundedness of the extended system in $\mathbb R^{2n}\times \mathcal H^{2n}$ with respect to the norm $\| (x,f) \|_{\text{ex}} = \|x\|_2 + \| f \|_{\mathcal H ^{2n}}$.
\end{proof}

Note that in practice, ensuring $\frac d {dt} H(z(t)) \leq 0$, requires a careful time integration of the dissipative system. The symplectic time integration of the extended system guarantees the correct evolution of the Hamiltonian.

We conclude this section by showing that the RDH method preserves the stability of the equilibrium points of the extended system. This provides a strong indication that the overall dynamics and stability of the original system system is translated into the RDH system. 

\begin{definition}
Consider a dynamical system of the form $\dot z = f( z)$ and suppose that $z_e$ is an equilibrium point for the system so that $ f( z_e) = 0$. $z_e$ is called Lyapunov stable if, for any $\epsilon > 0$, we can find $\delta > 0$ such that for any trajectory $\psi_t$, if $\| \psi_0 - z_e \|_{\text{ex}} \leq \delta$, then for all $0 \leq t < \infty$, we have $\| \psi_t - z_e \|_{\text{ex}} < \epsilon$.
\end{definition}

The Dirichlet's theorem \cite{bhatia2002stability}, states that the sufficient condition for an equilibrium point to be stable is the existence of a Lyapunov function \cite{bhatia2002stability}. In the context of the Hamiltonian systems, the Hamiltonian is a candidate for the Lyapunov function.

\begin{theorem}
Consider the Hamiltonian system \Cref{p3.eq:2.10.a,p3.eq:2.10.b,p3.eq:2.10.c} together with the reduced system \Cref{p3.eq:3.12.a,p3.eq:3.12.b,p3.eq:3.12.c}. Suppose that $(z_e,\phi_e,\theta_e)$ is an equilibrium point of \Cref{p3.eq:2.10.a,p3.eq:2.10.b,p3.eq:2.10.c} and that $z_e$ is in the range of the symplectic basis $A$. Further, suppose that $H_{\text{ex}}$ is a Lyapunov function ($\nabla^2_{(z,\phi,\theta)}H_{\text{ex}}$ is a positive definite operator). Then $(z_e,\phi_e,\theta_e)$ and $(A^+z_e,A^+\phi_e,A^+\theta_e)$ are lyapunov stable points of \Cref{p3.eq:2.10.a,p3.eq:2.10.b,p3.eq:2.10.c} and \Cref{p3.eq:2.10.a,p3.eq:2.10.b,p3.eq:2.10.c}), respectively.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof} It is easily checked that $(z_e,\phi_e,\theta_e)$ is a local minimum of $H_{\text{ex}}(z,\phi,\theta)$ and a lypunov stable point for (\ref{p3.eq:2.10.a})-(\ref{p3.eq:2.10.c}) and also $(A^+z_e,A^+\phi_e,A^+\theta_e)$ is a local minimum of $\tilde H(y,\tilde \phi,\tilde \theta) = H_{\text{ex}}(Ay,A\tilde \phi,A\tilde \theta)$. We notice that
\begin{equation}
	\nabla^2_{(y,\tilde \phi,\tilde \theta)}\tilde H_{\text{ex}} = \mathbf A^T \nabla^2_{(z,\phi,\theta)}H_{\text{ex}} \mathbf A,
\end{equation}
is positive definite. Therefore, $\tilde H$ is a lyapunov function for \Cref{p3.eq:2.10.a,p3.eq:2.10.b,p3.eq:2.10.c}) and $(A^+z_e,A^+\phi_e,A^+\theta_e)$ is a Lyapunov stable point of  \Cref{p3.eq:2.10.a,p3.eq:2.10.b,p3.eq:2.10.c}).
\end{proof}






\section{Numerical Results} \label{p3.sec:4}
In the following we illustrate the performance of the method through the reduced order model of the dissipative wave equation and a port-Hamiltonian model for a dissipative circuit.

\subsection{Dissipative wave equation} \label{sec:4.1}

Consider the dissipative linear wave equation
\begin{equation} \label{p3.eq:4.1}
	\left\{
	\begin{aligned}
		q_{t}(t,x) &= p(t,x), \\
		p_{t}(t,x) &= c^2 q_{xx}(t,x) - r(x)  p(t,x) , \\
		q(0,x) &= q_0(x), \\
		p(0,x) &= 0.
	\end{aligned}
	\right.
\end{equation}
where $x$ belongs to a one-dimensional torus of length $L$ and $r:[0,1]\to[0,1]$ is a positive semi-definite real valued function. 

We discretize the torus into $N_{\Delta x}$ equidistant points and define $\Delta x = L/N_{\Delta x}$, $x_i = i\Delta x$, $q_i=q(t,x_i)$ and $p_i=p(t,x_i)$ for $i = 1, \dots, N_{\Delta x}$. The discretization of $r$ corresponds to a diagonal and semi-positive definite matrix $r_\Delta$. Furthermore, we discretize (\ref{p3.eq:4.1}) using a standard central finite differences schemes to obtain
\begin{equation} \label{p3.eq:4.2}
	\dot z = \mathbb J_{2n} K^T K z - R z,
\end{equation}
where $z = (q_1,\dots,q_{N_{\Delta x}},p_1,\dots,p_{N_{\Delta x}})$ and $K$ and $R$ are given as
\begin{equation} \label{p3.eq:4.3}
	K^T K =
	\begin{pmatrix}
		I & 0 \\
		0 & c^2D_x^TD_x
	\end{pmatrix} , \quad
	R =
	\begin{pmatrix}
		0 & 0 \\
		0 & r_\Delta
	\end{pmatrix},
\end{equation}
with $D_x^TD_x = D_{xx}$ as the central finite differences matrix operator. Writing (\ref{p3.eq:4.2}) in a TDD formulation yields
\begin{equation} \label{p3.eq:4.4}
	\dot z = \mathbb J_{2n} K^T f(t), \quad f(t) + R \int_0^t f(s) \ ds = K z.
\end{equation}
Since $R$ is not time dependent, it commutes with the integration operator. The Hamiltonian extension of (\ref{p3.eq:4.4}), then takes the form (\ref{p3.eq:2.10.a})-(\ref{p3.eq:2.10.b}).

The initial condition used is given by
\begin{equation} \label{p3.eq:4.5}
	q_i(0) = h( 10\times|x_i - \frac{1}{2}| ), \quad p_i = 0, \quad i=1,\dots,N,
\end{equation}
where $h(s)$ is the cubic spline function
\begin{equation} \label{p3.eq:4.6}
h(s) = 
\left\{
\begin{aligned}
& 1 - \frac{3}{2}s^2 + \frac{3}{4}s^3, \quad & 0\leq s \leq 1, \\
& \frac{1}{4}(2-s)^3, & 1< s \leq 2, \\
& 0, & s > 2.
\end{aligned}
\right.
\end{equation}
For the numerical time integration of the extended Hamiltonian system, the Str\"omer-Verlet time stepping scheme \Cref{eq:2.23} is used. In each time step, the system of linear equations (\ref{p3.eq:2.11}) is solved to recover $z$. System parameters are summarized below.

\Cref{fig:4.1}.(a) shows the solution of the original dissipative wave equation (\ref{p3.eq:4.1}) at $t \in \{0,2.5,5,7.5\}$. For a nonzero $r_\Delta$ the solution will converge to $(q(t=\infty,x),p(t=\infty,x)) = (\rho,0)$ where $\rho$ is the center of mass of $q_0$. 

We construct the RDH reduced system according to the \Cref{alg:6.1} using a basis constructed by the greedy basis selection described in \Cref{alg:4.1}. The performance of the method is then compared to the POD and the PSD proposed in \cite{peng2016geometric}. The PSD method constructs a symplectic basis using the cotangent lift method \cite{peng2016geometric}. Note the cotangent lift method can also be used to construct a basis for the RDH method. However, the greedy method and the cotangent lift yield very similar results, inline with the results in previous works \cite{doi:10.1137/17M1111991}.

Figure \ref{fig:4.1}.(b) illustrates the decay of the singular values of the snapshot matrix \cite{hesthaven2015certified}, for the POD, PSD, and the RDH methods. Note that the snapshots for the PSD and the RDH are different since they have different canonical representations. The fast decay of the eigenvalues in all methods is a strong indicator for the existence of a low dimensional reduced system. The reduced bases are then constructed using 20, 40 and 60 number of modes.

The $L^2$-error between the full system and the RDH, the PSD, and the POD methods are presented in Figure \ref{fig:4.1}.(c). We notice that the symplectic methods provide a more accurate solution when compared to the POD method. In fact, the POD method does not yield a stable reduced system.  Furthermore, it is seen that enriching the PSD reduced basis does not yield a significant improvement in the accuracy of the reduced system. This happens as the PSD method, numerically integrate a non-conservative system with a symplectic integrator. This results in an incorrect evolution of the energy and eventually, in a qualitatively wrong numerical solution.

On the other hand, we notice that the RDH method with 40 modes provides a significantly more accurate solution compared to the PSD method with 60 modes. The RDH method provides a conservative reduced system where the dissipated energy is absorbed by the hidden strings and the conservation of the energy is then guaranteed by using a symplectic integrator. Therefore, we observe remarkable increase in the accuracy by enriching the RDH reduced basis.

Figure \ref{fig:4.1}.(d) shows the conservation of the energy in the different methods. The conservation law expressed in Theorem \ref{theorem:2.1} is destroyed through the POD model reduction and as a consequence we observe blow-up of the system energy. The symplectic methods preserves the energy significantly better. As discussed above, enriching the PSD basis does not significantly improve the preservation of energy. On the contrary, the RDH provides a substantial improvement in the accuracy of the energy.

In Figure \ref{fig:4.1}.(e) we show the transfer of the energy from the TDD system to the hidden strings, for the full system and the RDH reduced system. We notice that the RDH method preserves the total energy of the extended Hamiltonian system. Furthermore, the transfer of energy to the hidden strings in the full model is correctly translated in the reduced system.



The second numerical experiment is the dissipative wave equation (\ref{p3.eq:4.1}) in a near-zero dissipation regime. The numerical setting is taken to be identical to the previous numerical experiment, but with the difference that $r_i = 10^{-5}$, for $i=1,\dots,N_{\Delta x}$. Figure \ref{fig:4.1}.(f) shows the $L^2$-error between the solution to the reduced system and the full system, for the POD, the PSD, and the RDH methods. We notice that the POD does not yield a stable reduced system as the symplectic structure is lost via model reduction. Furthermore we notice that error for the PSD and the RDH coincide as the two methods become identical as $\| \chi \|_{\infty}\to 0$. Note that in this case the basis for the RDH method and PSD method are both generated using the cotangent lift method in order to show the convergence.


\subsection{The sine-Gordon equation}
Consider the one-dimensional dissipative nonlinear wave equation
\begin{equation} \label{p3.eq:added.4.1}
	\left\{
	\begin{aligned}
		q_{t}(t,x) &= p(t,x), \\
		p_{t}(t,x) &= q_{xx}(t,x) - \sin(q) - r(x)  p(t,x), \\
		q(0,x) &= q_0(x), \quad q(t,0) = a, \quad q(t,L) = b,\\
		p(0,x) &= p_0(x).
	\end{aligned}
	\right.
\end{equation}
defined on a domain of length $L$, which is known as the sine-Gordon equation. In the absence of dissipation, $r(x) = 0$, the \emph{kink} solution to (\ref{p3.eq:added.4.1}) is given as
\begin{equation} \label{p3.eq:added.4.2}
	q(t,x) = 4\arctan\left( \exp \left( \frac{(x-x_0 - vt)}{\sqrt{1-v^2}} \right) \right),
\end{equation}
where $|v|< 1$ is the wave speed. In the presence of dissipation, where $r(x)\geq 0$, the traveling wave de-accelerates and stops. The TDD formulation for (\ref{p3.eq:added.4.1}) takes the form
\begin{equation} \label{p3.eq:added.4.3}
	\dot z = \mathbb J_{2n} K^T f(t) + \mathbb J_{2n} g(z) - \mathbb J_{2n} z_{\text{bd}}, \quad f(t) + R \int_0^t f(s) \ ds = K z.	
\end{equation}
where $z$, $K$, $R$ and $f$ are defined similar to (\ref{p3.eq:4.4}), with $r_{\Delta} = rI_{n}$, and 
\begin{equation}
g(z) = (\sin(q_1),\dots,\sin(q_{N_{\Delta x}}),0,\dots,0)^T,
\end{equation}
and $z_{\text{bd}}$ is the term corresponding to the Dirichlet boundary condition. Note that the extended Hamiltonian $H_{ex}$ takes the form
\begin{equation}
	H_\text{ex}(z,\phi,\theta) = \frac 1 2 \left( \| Kz - \phi(t,0) \|_2^2 + \| G(z) \|_2^2 + \| \theta(t) \|^2_{\mathcal H^{2n} } + \| \partial_x\phi(t)\|^2_{\mathcal H^{2n} }\right),
\end{equation}
where $G(z)$ is a potential for $g(z)$ given as $G(q_i) = 1 - \sin(q_i)$, for $i=1,\dots,N_{\Delta_x}$. System parameters are summarized below

The RDH reduced system is constructed following Algorithm \ref{alg:6.1}. To reduce the complexity of the nonlinear term, we used the symplectic DEIM discussed in \Cref{sec:3.6}. The performance of the method is then compared to the SVD based method introduced in \Cref{chap:SyMo.PrSy:2} (here referred to as the ``PSD'') and the POD. To reduce the complexity of the nonlinear terms we compare the symplectic DEIM with the method proposed in \cite{doi:10.1137/140978922} and the classical DEIM in \Cref{sec:3.5}

\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:added4.1}.(a) shows the The $L^2$-error between the full system and the RDH, the PSD, and the POD methods. Although the Hamiltonian system of the sine-Gordon equation is nonlinear, the errors for the different methods show a similar behavior as those in Section (\ref{sec:4.1}). We observe that the POD does not yield a stable reduce system while the symplectic methods provide a high accuracy. Furthermore, we notice that enriching the PSD basis does not significantly enhance the accuracy of the method.

The evolution of error in the kinetic energy $K(p) = \|p\|_2^2/2$ is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:added4.1}.(b). We see that the POD does not conserve the evolution of the kinetic energy. The RDH method conserves the kinetic energy of the system with a higher accuracy than the PSD method. Furthermore, the accuracy of the RDH method is better scaled under enrichment of the reduced basis, compared to the PSD method. 

It is observed in Figure 1 that the symplectic treatment of the nonlinear terms is essential in correct model reduction of Hamiltonian systems. In addition, the SDEIM can be combined with the RDH method to construct a reduced Hamiltonian system that can be integrated using a symplectic integrator. Thus, the combination preserves the system energy and the symplectic symmetry of Hamiltonian systems.

\subsection{Port-Hamiltonian Systems}
Port-Hamiltonian systems are popular in network modeling and electrical engineering. In the framework of port-Hamiltonian modelling, energy conservation and Hamiltonian structure is the fundamental principle of the dynamics of the system. Ports in the system network then allows the exchange of energy with the environment in the form of sources, capacitors, and dissipations \cite{vanderSchaft:2014:PST:2693645.2693646}. Port-Hamiltonian systems can be viewed as a forced and dissipative Hamiltonian system.

\caption{$n$-dimensional ladder network} \label{fig:4.2}
\end{figure}

Consider the $n$-dimensional linear ladder network in Figure \ref{fig:4.2}. Here $C_i$, $L_i$ and $R_i$, $i=1,\dots,n$, are the capacitance, inductance and resistance of the corresponding capacitors, inductors, and resistors, respectively, and $R_{n+1}$ is the load capacitor. The port-Hamiltonian model of the linear ladder network takes the form
\begin{equation} \label{p3.eq:4.7}
		\dot x = (J_{2n} - R)Q^TQx + u.
\end{equation}
Here $x = (c_1,\phi_1,\dots,c_n,\phi_n)^T$ where $c_i$ and $\phi_i$, for $i=1,\dots,n$, are the charge and the flux of $C_i$ and $L_i$ respectively. $Q$ and $R$ are given as
\begin{equation}
	Q = \text{diag}(C_1^{-1},L_1^{-1},\dots,C_n^{-n},L_n^{-n}), \quad R = \text{diag}(0,R_1,\dots,0,R_n+R_{n+1}),
\end{equation}
$u=(1,0,\dots,0)^T$ is a constant input current and $J_{2n}$ is a skew-symmetric $2n\times 2n$ matrix with -1 and 1 on the superdiagonal and subdiagonal, respectively. 

The energy associated with a port-Hamiltonian system of the form (\ref{p3.eq:4.7}) at time $t$, is given as $H(x(t)) = \frac 1 2 x^T Q^T Q x$. Since $J_{2n}$ is skew symmetric we have that that $\frac d {dt} H(x) = u^T Q^T Q x - x^T Q^T Q R Q^T Q x \leq u^T Q^T Q x$ which is referred to as the \emph{passivity} of the system (\ref{p3.eq:4.7}) \cite{vanderSchaft:1996es,Willems:1972ek}.

Since $J_{2n}$ is full rank, one can always find a coordinate transformation $ x= T \tilde x$ such that $T^{-1} J_{2n} T^{-T} = \mathbb J_{2n}$. The dissipative Hamiltonian formulation of (\ref{p3.eq:4.7}) takes the form
\begin{equation} \label{p3.eq:4.8}
	\dot {\tilde x} = \mathbb J_{2n} \tilde Q^T\tilde Q \tilde x - \tilde Rx + \tilde u,
\end{equation}
where $\tilde Q = QT$, $\tilde R = T^{-1}RT^{-T}Q^TQ$ and $\tilde u = T^{-1} u$. Note that in this case, $\tilde R$ is symmetric and semi-positive definite since $T$ is orthogonal and $R$ is diagonal. The TDD formulation of (\ref{p3.eq:4.8}) takes the form
\begin{equation} \label{p3.eq:4.9}
	\dot{\tilde x} = \mathbb{J}_{2n} \tilde Q^T f(t) + \tilde u, \quad f(t) + \tilde R \int_0^t f(t) = \tilde Q \tilde x.
\end{equation}



The extended Hamiltonian formulation \Cref{p3.eq:2.10.a,p3.eq:2.10.b,p3.eq:2.10.b} with a quadratic Hamiltonian $H_{\text{ex}}$ can be carried out following \Cref{p3.sec:2}. We note that due to the input $\tilde u$, the Hamiltonian $H_{\text{ex}}$ is time dependent. In fact $\frac{d}{dt} H_{\text{ex}} = \tilde u^T\tilde Q^T \tilde Q \tilde x$. If we define $\overset{\circ}{H}_{\text{ex}} : \mathbb R^{2n}\times \mathcal H^{2n}\times \mathbb R^{2}\to \mathbb R$ as
\begin{equation} \label{p3.eq:4.10}
	\overset{\circ}{H}_{\text{ex}}(\tilde x,\phi,\theta,t,e) = H_{\text{ex}}(\tilde x,\phi,\theta,t) + e, \quad \dot e = - \partial_t H_{\text{ex}},
\end{equation}
it is easily checked that $\frac d {dt} \overset{\circ}{H}_{\text{ex}} =0$ \cite{hairer2006geometric}. However for the time integration of the Hamiltonian system related to $\overset{\circ}{H}_{\text{ex}}$ we can apply a symplectic integrator directly on (\ref{p3.eq:4.10}), since the evolution of $\tilde x$, $\phi$ and $\theta$ does not explicitly depend on $e$. Thus, the passivity of (\ref{p3.eq:4.7}) will be preserved through a symplectic time integration of (\ref{p3.eq:4.9}).

Using an ortho-symplectic reduced basis $A$, the reduced dissipative Hamiltonian method can be applied to (\ref{p3.eq:4.9}) to construct a reduced system of the form (\ref{p3.eq:3.12.a}) to (\ref{p3.eq:3.12.b}) together with the extended Hamiltonian $\tilde H_{\text{ex}}$. We note that the method is also passivity preserving since $\frac{d}{dt} \tilde H_{\text{ex}} = (A^+ \tilde u)^T A^T \tilde Q^T \tilde Q A y$. Furthermore, the dissipative Hamiltonian structure of the reduced system indicates that the reduced system also carries a port-Hamiltonian structure.

We consider a 100-dimensional ($n=50$) port-Hamiltonian system for the ladder network discussed above. We take $C_i=1$, $L_i = 1$, $R_i=0.2$ for $i=1,\dots,50$, and $R_{51} = 0.4$. We construct the RDH reduced system following Algorithm \ref{alg:6.1}. 

The solution of the RDH method is compared to the main results of \cite{polyuga2010structure}, where a passivity-preserving model reduction is developed using a moment matching method at infinity. The charge in $C_1$ is chosen to be the single out put for the moment matching method.

\end{figure}

Reduced bases of size $2k = 10$, $2k = 20$ and $2k = 30$ are constructed with the RDH and the moment matching method. Figure \ref{fig:4.3}.(c) shows the error in the charge in $C_1$ for the two methods. We observe that although the moment matching method is bounded over long-time integration, the RDH method provides a significantly more accurate solution. In the moment matching method, the passivity of the reduced system implies that the energy of the system will be bounded by the input energy. However, there is no guarantee that the dissipation of energy in the reduced system mimics the one of the original system. On the other hand, the RDH method allows a correct dissipation of energy through the hidden strings and the symplectic time integration in the RDH method guarantees that the total energy is preserved.

Over short-time integration, we notice that the moment matching method with 10 modes provides a more accurate solution than the RDH with 10 modes. Furthermore, the moment matching method with 20 and 30 modes provide a comparable accuracy to the RDH method with 20 and 30 modes. However, the RDH method maintains the high accuracy during long-time integration, while the moment matching method loses up to 3 orders of magnitude in the accuracy, independent of the number of modes.

Figure \ref{fig:4.3}.(a) and Figure \ref{fig:4.3}.(b) show the average temporal error in the charge and flux of the capacitors and inductors, respectively. The RDH method provides a significantly better accuracy compared to the moment matching method. This is because the charge of $C_1$ is specified as the output of interest in the moment matching method and so it is expected that that method provides low accuracy for computing other outputs. On the other hand, the RDH method not only provides high accuracy in computing the charge for $C_1$ but also high accuracy for all components of the system.

\section{Conclusion} \label{p3.sec:5}

In this chapter we presented the reduced dissipative Hamiltonian method. The method preserves the symplectic structure of dissipative Hamiltonian systems and guarantees the correct dissipation of energy through time integration. The RDH method couples the reduced system with a canonical heat bath such that the reduced system forms a closed system.

The main advantage of the RDH method compared to the existing methods is that it enables the reduced system to be integrated using a symplectic integrator which naturally preserves the Hamiltonian structure and the symplectic symmetry of the Hamiltonian systems. Applying a symplectic integrator to a non-conservative system or using a non-symplectic integrator for the reduced system can cause accumulation of local errors or wrong qualitative solution over long-time integration, respectively.

The numerical simulations illustrate that the RDH method preserves the system energy with significantly higher accuracy than other methods. Furthermore, it is shown that the hidden strings assure that the dissipation of energy in the reduce system mimics the dissipation of energy in the full system. This ensures that the local error do not accumulate over long-time integration.
