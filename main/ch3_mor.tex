\chapter{Model Order Reduction} \label{chapter:3}
Mathematical simulation is now evermore important in engineering, science, and related domains, thanks to expeditious advances in computational sciences and rapid growth in computational capacities over the past decades. Numerical evaluation of partial differential equations lies at the core of these disciplines which allows design, optimization, and prediction of
